Try to eat a well-balanced, low-fat diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and lean meats. For long-lasting energy, doctors also recommend having up to a third of your diet be composed of starches and carbohydrates (whole wheat varieties are preferable).")
    print("Stay hydrated.  The health benefits of drinking lots of water are numerous - it can help you lose weight, prevent kidney stones, and much more.[2] Water can also increase stamina by fighting muscle fatigue. Muscle tissue that is under-hydrated can under-perform, so keep your stamina up by drinking water a few hours before strenuous exercise and during your workout as well.")
    print("Exercise.Though it will tire you out in the short term, physical exercise increases your overall energy level and stamina over a long period of time. For optimal health and increased stamina, make time in your schedule for regular exercise. For adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise per week (or 75 minutes of intense cardiovascular exercise), along with strength-building exercise sessions at least twice a week.Cardiovascular exercise, such as aerobics, running, biking, and dancing, exercises your heart and lungs, increasing the efficiency with which your body supplies oxygen to its muscles. As a result, your body's endurance and stamina will gradually increase (and its fatigue levels decrease) with cardiovascular exercise.Strength-building exercises, such as weightlifting and body weight exercises (push ups, sit ups, etc.) gradually build the stamina (not to mention the size, definition, and strength) of your muscles. Over time, you'll notice a definite difference - you'll be able to lift bigger loads for longer. ")
